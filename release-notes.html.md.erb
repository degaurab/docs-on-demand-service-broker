## <a id="release-notes"></a>v0.27.0
**Release Date: April 4, 2019**

<p class="note breaking"><strong>Breaking Change:</strong> To support multiple stemcells for a service deployment,
  the On Demand Services SDK has replaced ServiceDeployment.Stemcell with ServiceDeployment.Stemcells.
  For more information,
  see <a href="https://github.com/pivotal-cf/on-demand-services-sdk/commit/f88592e968ebb3a327d5689ed6772268a2c0fcfc">[BREAKING CHANGE]
  SDK now supports multi-stemcell deployment</a> in GitHub.</p>

<p class="note breaking"><strong>Breaking Change:</strong> The broker now uses BOSH Process Manager (BPM).
 When configuring the broker job, assign to <code>service_adapter.mount_path</code> a list of filesystem paths to the files that service adapter uses, such as config files.
 Work is planned to include BPM on errands in the future.
 For more information on configuring your broker, see <a href="./operating.html#core-broker-config">Configure Your Broker</a>.
