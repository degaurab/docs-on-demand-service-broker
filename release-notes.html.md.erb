The below might not be true anymore

<p class="note breaking"><strong>Breaking Change:</strong> If you set <code>cf_service_access</code> to <code>org-restricted</code> in the <code>
  register-broker</code> errand, you must set <code>service_access_org</code> in
  each plan in the broker service catalog.
For an example of a plan configured as <code>org-restricted</code>, see <a href="./management.html#register-broker">Register Broker</a>.</p>

<p class="note breaking"><strong>Breaking Change:</strong> You can no longer set service access for all plans with the <code>enable_service_access</code> property. This property has been removed. You must set service access for individual plans with <code>cf_service_access</code>. This property defaults to <code>enable</code>. For more information about configuring service access for plans, see <a href="./management.html#register-broker">Register Broker</a>.</p>
