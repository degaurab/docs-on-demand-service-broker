## <a id="release-notes"></a>v0.25.0

**Release Date: December 3, 2018**

### Features

New features and changes in this release:

- Introduces a new errand `recreate-all-service-instances`. This should be added to service
 broker manifests to enable operators to recreate all service instances
 managed by a broker. If your broker has lifecycle errands configured, these will NOT be run by the `recreate-all-service-instances` errand. We plan to implement this functionality in a future release.
 This errand may be useful for:
   * performing a seamless rotation of the Ops Manager root CA. For further information, see the [Ops Manager cert rotation docs](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-2/security/pcf-infrastructure/api-cert-rotation.html#rotate-ca).
   * performing a full restore of the platform, such as during disaster recovery or migrations.

- Adds a new configuration option for the `cf_service_access` broker property. This allows brokers to be configured to enable service access for a single org only. Previously it was only possible to enable access either for all or no orgs.
- Upgrades golang to v1.11.2
