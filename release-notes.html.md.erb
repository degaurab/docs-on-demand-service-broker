## <a id="release-notes"></a>v0.25.0

**Release Date: December 3, 2018**

### Features

New features and changes in this release:

- Introduces the `recreate-all-service-instances` errand.
The errand enables operators to recreate all service instances managed by a broker.
This errand may be useful when doing the following:
<ul>
   <li> A seamless rotation of the Ops Manager root certificate authority (CA).</li>
   <li>A full restore of the platform, such as during disaster recovery or migration.</li>
</ul>
The `recreate-all-service-instances` errand does not trigger lifecycle errands.
For how to use this errand, see [Recreate All Service Instances](./management.html#recreate-all-service-instances).
- Adds a new configuration option for the `cf_service_access` broker property.
This allows you to configure the broker to enable service access for a single org only.
This allows brokers to be configured to enable service access for a single org only.
Previously it was only possible to enable access either for all or no orgs.
- Upgrades golang to v1.11.2
