## <a id="release-notes"></a>v0.26.0

**Release Date: February 20, 2019**

<p class="note breaking"><strong>Breaking Change:</strong> Functions have been refactored
   to use data structures instead of positional parameters.
   This is to reduce future breaking changes to the SDK interfaces.
<br>
<br>
Service authors using the On-Demand Services SDK must modify the signatures of their implementations
of the interface methods to accept the new structs instead of positional parameters.
They must also replace all references to positional arguments with references to the new struct properties.
For a list of the structs see <a href="service-adapter.html#interfaces">Interfaces</a>.
</p>

### Features

New features and changes in this release:

- Service adapters can return multiple BOSH configs (for example, cloud-config or runtime-config) when generating their manifests.
  These configs are applied before deployment and are only available for that particular deployment.
  Configs are deleted when a deployment is deleted.
- The `register-broker` errand spec uses the broker link to configure Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF).
  The following properties can be removed from the errand job in your manifest
  because they are silently ignored: `cf.api_url`, `cf.admin_username`, `cf.admin_password`.
- The service catalog on the broker returns `maintenance_info`, which can be used to trigger a single-instance upgrade in the broker.
  Platforms can implement functionality needed to expose this feature.
- The `recreate-all-service-instances` errand triggers service instance post-deploy errands.
  Supported versions: Ops Manager 2.2.16 and later (BOSH Director 266.10.0+), Ops Manager 2.3.10 and later (BOSH Director 267.10.0+),
  Ops Manager 2.4.3 and later (BOSH Director 268.2.2+), Ops Manager 2.5 and later (BOSH Director 268.4.0+).
- Golang is upgraded to v1.11.5.

### Known Issues

- Post-deploy errands might not run in Ops Manager v2.2 and v2.3.
This is due to a problem with how the `recreate-all-service-instances` errand checks
the version of the BOSH Director.
Ops Manager v2.1 and v2.4 and later are not affected.

### Minimum Version Requirements

The following are minimum version requirements for this release:

- BOSH v266.12.0 or v267.6.0 and later
- Cloud Foundry v238 and later

For PCF version support, see [Product Snapshot](./index.html#product-snapshot).
