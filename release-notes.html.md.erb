<p class="note breaking"><strong>Breaking Change:</strong> Service Instances
API configuration has moved from the <code>upgrade-all-service-instances</code>
errand to the broker job.
For more information, see <strong>Features</strong> below.</p>

<p class="note breaking"><strong>Breaking Change:</strong> The service adapter
  method <code>GenerateManifest()</code> takes a new parameter, <code>previousSecrets</code>.
  This parameter contains secrets from the previously deployed service instance manifest.</p>

### Features

New features and changes in this release:

- The `orphan-deployments` errand can use the Service Instances API. This
change only impacts brokers that are installed without Cloud Foundry. The
configuration for this was previously on the `update-all-service-instances`
errand, and has been moved to the broker job. <br><br>The same
configuration is used for both the `orphan-deployments` and `upgrade-all`
errands.
- Upgrades the CredHub CLI library to enable use with both v1 and v2 CredHub servers.
This is required to use Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) v2.4 and later.
- Upgrades golang to v1.11.2.
- Adds the parameter `previousSecrets` to the `GenerateManifest()` method in
the Service Adapter.
